                        An unforgettable true story about the potential for mercy to redeem us, and a clarion call to
                        end mass
                        incarceration in America — from one of the most inspiring lawyers of our time.

                        Bryan Stevenson was a young lawyer when he founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit law
                        office
                        in Montgomery, Alabama, dedicated to defending the poor, the incarcerated, and the wrongly
                        condemned.

                        Just Mercy tells the story of EJI, from the early days with a small staff facing the nation’s
                        highest
                        death sentencing and execution rates, through a successful campaign to challenge the cruel
                        practice of
                        sentencing children to die in prison, to revolutionary projects designed to confront Americans
                        with our
                        history of racial injustice.

                        One of EJI’s first clients was Walter McMillian, a young black man who was sentenced to die for
                        the
                        murder of a young white woman that he didn’t commit. The case exemplifies how the death penalty
                        in
                        America is a direct descendant of lynching — a system that treats the rich and guilty better
                        than the
                        poor and innocent.
                        <br>
                        <h4>Plot</h4>
                        In 1989, idealistic young Harvard law graduate Bryan Stevenson travels to Alabama hoping to help
                        fight
                        for poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. He meets with Eva Ansley and
                        founds the
                        Equal Justice Initiative, then travels to a prison to meet its death row inmates. He meets
                        Walter
                        "Johnny D." McMillian, an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda
                        Morrison, a
                        white woman. Bryan looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the
                        testimony
                        of convicted felon Ralph Myers, who provided a highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange
                        for a
                        lighter sentence in his own pending trial.

                        Bryan's first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid, but Chapman dismisses him without
                        even
                        looking at his notes. Bryan next asks McMillian family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he
                        was
                        with a witness who corroborated Myers' testimony the day of the murder, which would cause the
                        prosecution's case to fall apart. When Bryan submits Darnell's testimony, police arrest him for
                        perjury.
                        While Bryan is able to get the perjury charges dismissed, Darnell is intimidated into refusing
                        to
                        testify in court.

                        Bryan then approaches Myers himself, who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after
                        police
                        played to his fear of burning and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Bryan
                        appeals to
                        the local court to grant Walter a retrial. and successfully convinces Myers to recant his
                        testimony on
                        the stand, but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught, Bryan vents his
                        frustrations about the case to Eva. He appears on 60 Minutes to rally public support in favor of
                        Walter,
                        then appeals to the Supreme Court of Alabama. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's
                        decision,
                        and grants Walter his retrial. Bryan then motions to have the charges dismissed entirely. He
                        confronts
                        Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects
                        him from
                        his property. The day of the motion comes, and Bryan appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to
                        join him in
                        his motion, the case is dismissed, and Walter is finally reunited with his family.

                        An epilogue notes that Bryan and Eva continue to fight for justice to the present day. Walter
                        remained
                        friends with Bryan until his death in 2013. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's death
                        confirmed
                        Walter's innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been
                        solved.

                        goods and Toys "R" Us, before deciding to embark on a career as an actor.[12][13] He launched
                        his career as a professional actor in 1999, when he appeared briefly in single episodes of the

                        when he was featured in Hardball, which starred Keanu Reeves. In 2002, he gained more attention
                        by playing the small but pivotal role of Wallace in the first season of HBO's The Wire. In March
                        2003, he joined the cast of All My Children, replacing Chadwick Boseman, playing Reggie

                        BuddyTV ranked him #80 on its list of "TV's Sexiest Men of 2011".[21] Jordan voiced Jace in the
                        Xbox 360 game Gears of War 3.[22] Jordan also featured in the popular sports game NBA 2K17 and
                        voiced Justice Young, a teammate of yours in MyPlayer.

                        In 2012, Jordan appeared in the George Lucas-produced movie Red Tails[23] and played lead
                        character Steve Montgomery in Chronicle, a film about three teenaged boys who develop superhuman
                        abilities.[24] He also guest-starred in an episode of House's final season, playing a blind

                    <p>In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista's song, "Slow Jamz", together with Kanye West, which
                        reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His
                        second collaboration with Kanye West, "Gold Digger," in which Foxx sang the Ray
                        Charles-influenced "I Got a Woman" hook, then went straight to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100,
                        remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single "Georgia" by Atlanta rappers
                        Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles' hit "Georgia on My Mind".

                        Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray (2004), for which he won the
                        Academy Award for Best Actor[5] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is
                        the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar
                        nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray. In 2005, Foxx was
                        invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[16]

                        Foxx released his second studio album, Unpredictable, in December 2005. It debuted at #2,
                        selling 598,000 copies in its first week,[17] rising to #1 the following week and selling an
                        additional 200,000 copies.[18] To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United
                        States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[19][20] The album also charted on the UK
                        Albums Chart, where it peaked at #9.[21] Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an
                        Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a #1 album in the U.S, joining Frank
                        Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand. Foxx's first single from the album, the title track
                        "Unpredictable" (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also
                        made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples "Wildflower" by New Birth. The second US
                        single from the album was "DJ Play a Love Song," which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the
                        second single was "Extravaganza", which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West,
                        although Foxx did not feature in the song's music video.</p>

                        Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers (born October 1, 1989), known professionally as Brie Larson, is an
                        American
                        actress and filmmaker. Noted for her supporting work in comedies when a teenager, she has since
                        expanded
                        to leading roles in independent dramas and film franchises, receiving such accolades as an
                        Academy
                        Award
                        and a Golden Globe. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world
                        in
                        2019.

                        Born in Sacramento, California, Larson was homeschooled. At age six, she became the youngest
                        student
                        admitted to a training program at the American Conservatory Theater. She soon relocated to Los
                        Angeles
                        and began her acting career in 1998 with a comedy sketch in The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She
                        appeared
                        as a regular in the 2001 sitcom Raising Dad and briefly dabbled with a music career, releasing
                        the
                        album
                        Finally Out of P.E. in 2005. Larson subsequently played supporting roles in the comedy films
                        Hoot
                        (2006), Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and 21 Jump Street (2012), and appeared as a
                        sardonic
                        teenager in the television series United States of Tara (2009–2011).

                    <h4>Career</h4>
                    <p>Larson's first major role came as Emily, the younger daughter of Bob Saget's character, in the WB
                        sitcom Raising Dad, which aired for one season during the 2001–02 television schedule.[20] Hal
                        Boedeker of Orlando Sentinel criticized the program and wrote that its cast members were
                        "merrily joking through the show".[21] She was next hired for the ABC sitcom Hope & Faith, but
                        she and some other cast members were replaced after an unaired pilot.[22] In 2003, she starred
                        alongside Beverley Mitchell in the Disney Channel movie Right on Track, based on the junior drag
                        race star sisters Erica and Courtney Enders, and played minor roles in the 2004 comedies
                        Sleepover and 13 Going on 30.[23][24][25]

                        Larson developed an interest in music at age 11 when she learned to play the guitar. A music
                        executive encouraged her to write her own songs, and she began self-recording and uploading
                        tracks to her own website.[26][27] After failing to get cast as Wendy Darling in the 2003 film
                        Peter Pan, Larson penned and recorded a song named "Invisible Girl", which received airplay on
                        KIIS-FM.[12][15] She soon signed a recording deal with Tommy Mottola of Casablanca Records; she
                        and Lindsay Lohan were the only artists signed by the label at that time.[12][28][29] In 2005,
                        she released the album Finally Out of P.E., in which she also co-wrote songs with other
                        songwriters, including Blair Daly, Pam Sheyne, Lindy Robbins, and Holly Brook.[28][30] She named
                        it after a gym teacher she disliked and has said that the songs she wrote were mostly about
                        failed job opportunities.[15][30] One of her singles, "She Said", was featured in the MTV series
                        Total Request Live, was listed by Billboard in their weekly listings of the most-played videos
                        in the channel, and peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot Single Sales.[31][32][33] Larson
                        went on tour with Jesse McCartney for Teen People's "Rock in Shop" mall concerts, opened for him
                        during his Beautiful Soul tour, and also performed in New York City at the Macy's Thanksgiving
                        Day Parade. Even so, the album was not a success, selling only 3,500 copies.[30][34][35] Larson
                        later admitted to being disillusioned with her music career, saying, "I wanted to write all my
                        own songs, and [the recording company] were afraid of that. I wanted to wear sneakers and play
                        my guitar—they wanted heels and wind blown hair."[28]

                        In 2006, Larson was cast alongside Logan Lerman and Cody Linley in the comedy film Hoot, about
                        young vigilantes trying to save a group of owls. It received poor reviews, but Ruthe Stein of
                        San Francisco Chronicle was appreciative of Larson and Linley for bringing "a dash of Indiana
                        Jones to their roles".[36][37] She had a small part, the following year, in the Amber
                        Heard-starring drama Remember the Daze, and she launched an arts and literature magazine, named
                        Bunnies and Traps, for which she wrote her own opinion columns and accepted submissions from
                        other artists and writers.[27][38] Larson has said that she frequently considered giving up
                        acting at that time, as she found it difficult to find much work, blaming it on filmmakers'
                        inability to typecast her.[4] She was particularly discouraged when she lost out on key roles in
                        the films Thirteen (2003) and Juno (2007).[39] To support herself, Larson worked as a club
                        DJ.[40]</p>

                    Available on AMAZON, and displayed in Theaters near you!
                    A powerful and thought-provoking true story, “Just Mercy” follows young lawyer Bryan Stevenson
                    (Jordan)
                    and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryan had his pick of
                    lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned or who were not
                    afforded
                    proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley (Larson). One of his first, and
                    most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for
                    the
                    notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence
                    and
                    the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years
                    that follow, Bryan becomes embroiled in a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt
                    and
                    unabashed racism as he fights for Walter, and others like him, with the odds—and the system—stacked
                    against them.
